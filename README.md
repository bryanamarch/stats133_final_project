Description: We are all currently students in Stats 133 and this is our final project for the semester. We are looking at the history and trend of airplane accidents from 1920 to the present. We will be focusing on ideas such as what months tend to have more airplane accidents and how the type of aircraft that has gotten into accidents has changed over time.
